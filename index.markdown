## Features

- **High quality volumetric lighting** (directional, point, spot) with soft shadows.
- **Built-in save/load** - save or load entire state of the engine in one call.
- **Full-featured scene graph** with various nodes (pivot, camera, mesh, light, particle system, sprite).
- **High quality binaural sound** with Head-Related Transfer Function (HRTF) support.
- **Standalone scene editor** - make scenes in native engine format.
- **Multi-camera rendering** - allows you to create picture-in-picture effects, make split-screen games
and so on.
- **Skinning** with flexible animation system.
- **Multiple scenes** support - allows you to have separate scenes for game menu, levels and so on.
- **Normal and environment** mapping.
- **Level-of-detail (LOD)** support - allows you to change details of distant models to improve performance.
- **Screen-Space Ambient Occlusion** (SSAO).
- **Geometry instancing** - render lots of objects without any overhead.
- **Render in texture** - each scene can be rendered into separate texture which, for example, allows you to build "screens" in your game.
- **Sky box** - add details for outdoor scenes.
- **Lightmap generator** - bake static lights into texture to improve runtime performance.
- **Particle systems** with soft particles - flexible particles system allows you to build complex effects.
- **Navmesh with `A*` pathfinder** - build navigation mesh for pathfinding and search paths on in.
- **FBX Loader** - allows you to load models of any complexity from industry-standard FBX format.
- **TTF/OTF fonts** support.
- **Support of various texture formats**, such as: png, jpg, dds (including compressed), tga, bmp, etc.
- **Advanced user interface** with lots of widgets.
- **Advanced animation system** with animation blending machines (similar to Mecanim) and animation retargetting.
- **Async asset management** (textures, models, sound buffers).
- **Advanced physics**: rigid bodies, rich set of various colliders, joints, ray casting, etc.
- **Powerful core library** with lots of commonly used algorithms.
- **Fast iterative compilation**: ~3 seconds in Debug, ~8 seconds in Release.
- **Lots of examples** covering various aspects of the engine.
- **Production ready** - it is possible to build almost any kind of game.
- **Documentation**
