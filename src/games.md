The game is a sci-fi DeadSpace-like horror game, the action takes place on the spaceship that stays radio-silent near Saturn. The main character had crashed in the loading bay, he's the only survivor, he has no other option but to start exploring the main ship to find a way to escape (this is the main goal).
